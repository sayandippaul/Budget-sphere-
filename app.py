For every category:

Briefly define what it includes.

Suggest practical ways to reduce expenses by approximately the given percentage.

Offer realistic, non-judgmental tips the user can follow immediately.

The output should be clear, crisp, and actionable â€” no emojis, no fluff.

Ensure that each bullet point feels personalized and helpful for someone trying to improve their monthly budgeting based on AI feedback.

Use the percentages dynamically and focus on making the advice realistic and easy to implement.
